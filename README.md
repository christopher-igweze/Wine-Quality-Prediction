## Wine Quality Prediction with K-Means Clustering and Multiple Predictive Models

>This repository contains a comprehensive project on wine quality prediction using various machine learning techniques. The project incorporates the use of K-means clustering as a preprocessing step, followed by the development and evaluation of predictive models utilizing logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks. Additionally, two variations of the models are implemented, one with an added feature representing the wine's assigned cluster and another without this additional feature.

*Key Features*:
- **K-Means Clustering**: The project begins with the application of K-means clustering to group the wines based on their characteristics. This clustering step helps in identifying natural patterns and similarities among the wines, aiding the subsequent modeling process.
- **Logistic Regression**: One of the predictive models employed in this project is logistic regression, which utilizes the wine's input features to predict its quality. This model provides an interpretable and probabilistic approach to classification.
- **Random Forest**: Another predictive model used is the random forest algorithm, which leverages an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. The random forest model can capture complex relationships between the input features and the wine quality.
- **Neural Networks**: The project also includes the implementation of neural networks for wine quality prediction. Two neural network models are developedâ€”one with an added feature indicating the cluster membership and the other without this additional information. Neural networks offer the advantage of capturing non-linear relationships in the data and can potentially provide improved predictive performance.
- **Comparative Analysis**: The project emphasizes the comparison and evaluation of the different predictive models. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess the performance of each model variant. Additionally, visualizations and statistical analyses are employed to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models.

> The repository provides a clear structure and well-documented code, allowing for easy reproduction and extension of the project. Detailed explanations and visualizations are included to enhance the understanding of the implemented techniques. The project serves as a valuable resource for wine enthusiasts, data scientists, and researchers interested in wine quality prediction and the application of clustering and multiple machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
